  {name: "24/7 AOG Support Service", description: "ASC operates 24 hours, 365 days a year with a dedicated AOG team to support your requirements around the clock. Our team will ensure your requirement is dealt with as a matter of urgency, and respond with a cost effective, tailored solution. A 24 hour Stores team is also on-site to prepare, ship and track the unit from despatch to delivery to the end user."},
  {name: "Component Lease Packages", description: "ASC offers rotable lease packages tailored to suit customer's requirements in terms of content, lease term, stock location and support arrangements. ASC pride ourselves on our flexible approach, and as such are willing and able to renegotiate any lease package throughout the term so as to provide the operator with maximum benefit at minimum cost.\nThe lease package can be provided as a stand-alone service, or included within a more comprehensive PBH support agreement. Any package can also incorporate wheels and brakes equipment and LRUs.\nWhere operators have surplus inventory and are looking for an exit strategy for a particular stock or fleet type, ASC can offer to purchase the stock and offer a lease-back agreement covering all or part of that inventory. This reduces the capital investment required by the operator for what is a depreciating asset whilst maintaining reliable access."},
  {name: "Component Repair Management", description: "ASC have a dedicated repair team to process and track our customers' rotable components through our network of industry-leading MRO facilities, as well as our in-house repair workshop at London Stansted Airport. Our experienced team has recently expanded to match the increased volume of repairs put through ASC every month. Our repairs focus extends through the management, with the GM and Directors coming from repairs backgrounds at major Airlines and MROs. Since our establishment in 2006, ASC have built up collaborative relationships with many OEMs, including Curtiss Wright, Honeywell, and Messier Bugatti.\nOur flexible, customer-driven approach to repair management ensures our customers receive a fully interactive, competitive service, backed up through an extensive exchange inventory housed at our London Gatwick facility.\nThrough effective and well-managed repair outsourcing operators can often identify excess levels of stockholding. Such surplus inventory can either be sold or traded for additional income â€“ both of which ASC are ideally placed to assist with."},
